# Biography
My name is Chris Gravelle, but all my friends call me Donnan. I graduated from Saint John's University in 2019 with a BA in Philosophy. I then attended the University of Edinburgh's Mind, Language, and Embodied Cognition MSc, which I completed in Summer 2020. During that program I completed a dissertation titled "An Ecological Theory of Concepts" where I formulated a theory of affordance weighting and low level sensorimotor categorization based on models of affordance competition. I am currently a student at the CUNY Graduate Center in the Cognitive and Comparative Psychology PhD training program.

## Aims for this course
I got into psychology through philosophy. Reading philosophers like Daniel Dennett and Andy Clark convinced me that the best way to understand the mind is through a multidisciplinary approach. This led me to take a hybrid philosophy of cognitive science/psychology masters program. 

My goals for this course are to further solidify my understanding of what is considered "canonical" cognitive psychology. I love a lot of the weirder avant-garde cognitive science, such as 4E cognition, but knowledge of those approaches alone do not make for good science. Before one embraces the paradigm that preaches rebellion, it is probably good to fully understand just what it is rebelling against. 

## Research Interests
I am personally interested in piecing together how animals go from sensorimotor machines to full fledged thinkers, or to borrow the title from Daniel Dennett's latest book, how we get "From Bacteria to Bach". One way to do this is to look at ways to "scale up"; to investigate how sensorimotor systems can be put to work on more abstract domains of cognition. I've investigated this in my masters dissertation by positing categorization mechanisms that arise naturally out of the feedback of affordance competition. This was my way of trying to create a "scaling up" story that can get us to the theories of sensorimotor simulation and categorization that are very popular within traditional cognitive psychology. 

Another way to attempt to "scale up" is to investigate language and language acquisition. This is my principle research project at the moment, and relates heavily to conceptual and linguistic embodiment. If one can show how sensorimotor systems can result in the linguistic and conceptual structures underlying communication, then this would be a great boon to the "scaling up" project. 

### How this blog will be used

When attempting to construct a story of how the mind works, even if the scope of the story is conservative in scope, there are a lot of moving parts and loose threads. Apart from using this blog for course work, I will most likely continue using it to get my ideas somewhere in the open. That way, instead of working on abstract ideas "in my head", there is something pseudo-physical that I can manipulate instead. Hopefully this will organize my ideas more effectively.
